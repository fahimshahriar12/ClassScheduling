# Introduction

1. Shortest Job First(SJF) Scheduling : Shortest Job First scheduling works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first. This is the best approach to minimize waiting time.his scheduling algorithm is optimal if all the jobs/processes are available at the same time. To successfully implement it, the burst time/duration time of the processes should be known to the processor in advance, which is practically not feasible all the time.

2. Priority CPU Scheduling : In the Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm, the priority of a process is generally the inverse of the CPU burst time, i.e. the larger the burst time the lower is the priority of that process. In case of priority scheduling the priority is not always set as the inverse of the CPU burst time, rather it can be internally or externally set, but yes the scheduling is done on the basis of priority of the process where the process which is most urgent is processed first, followed by the ones with lesser priority in order.


# Consideration

Describe what you have considered
1. Shortest Job First (SJF) : According to the definition, short processes are executed first and then followed by longer processes.The throughput is increased because more processes can be executed in less amount of time.

2. Priority CPU Scheduling : The priority of a process can be selected based on memory requirement, time requirement or user preference. For example, a high end game will have better graphics, that means the process which updates the screen in a game will have higher priority so as to achieve better graphics performance.
